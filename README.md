Originally my blog was a Joomla 1.5 website, I've recently converted it to [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll). I took into account almost all pages; I was able to redirect or re-create the original urls for posts/categories with ease. I am so impressed with Jekyll and wanted to share my findings here. I'll probably write some blog posts about them as well.
